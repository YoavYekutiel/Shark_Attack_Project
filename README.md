# Shark Attack Analysis

## Description
This project involves analyzing shark attack data to uncover trends and insights. The analysis includes examining factors such as the gender and age of victims, the timing and location of attacks, and the activities that victims were engaged in during the attacks.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YoavYekutiel/Shark_Attack_Project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Shark_Attack_Project
   ```

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv env
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the analysis, open the provided Jupyter notebook and execute the cells sequentially. The notebook includes code and visualizations that guide you through the analysis process.

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open the `Shark Attack - 5.ipynb` file** and run the cells to see the analysis.

## Features

### General Information:
- 80% of those attacked are male, 10% are female, and the remaining 10% are unknown.
- Over 20% of the attacks are fatal.
- The median age of those attacked is 27-28 years old.

### Monthly Attack Analysis:
- January has the highest number of attacks and fatal attacks.
- Australia is the country with the most attacks.
- Young people in Australia experience the highest number of fatal attacks in January, with swimming being the most common activity during these attacks.

### Activity Analysis:
- Surfing is the most common activity associated with shark attacks, followed by swimming.
- Swimming is significantly more fatal than surfing.
- In the USA in June, the chance of being fatally attacked while swimming is the lowest, whereas in South Africa in January, the chance is highest for young men.

### Gender-Specific Analysis:
- The highest number of attacks on women occur in the USA in July.
- Compared to worldwide attacks on women, those in the USA are much less fatal.
- There are slightly more attacks occurring around noon and fewer in the morning hours.
- In the USA, women are attacked more during wading and less during surfing compared to worldwide trends.
